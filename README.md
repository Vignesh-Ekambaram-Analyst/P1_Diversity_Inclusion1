# Project Title:ðŸ“Š Diversity & Inclusion Dashboard â€“ HR Analytics for Gender Balance

## Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of gender diversity in hiring, promotions, and turnover rates across different job levels. It aims to help HR professionals identify trends, disparities, and areas for improvement in achieving gender balance at the executive level.

### Business Problem
Despite efforts toward gender diversity, there remains a gap in representation at executive management levels. This project explores key HR metrics to uncover insights into hiring, promotion, and attrition trends that may contribute to this imbalance.

### Key KPIs Tracked
- **Hiring Trends â€“** Breakdown of new hires by gender across job levels.    
- **Promotions Analysis â€“** Gender distribution in promotions and average time-in-grade before promotion.    
- **Turnover Rate â€“** Comparison of performance ratings between leavers and non-leavers.    
- **Gender Representation in Leadership â€“** Identifying bottlenecks preventing equitable progression.    

### Key Insights & Findings
- **Hiring Patterns:** Higher representation of men in senior positions suggests potential hiring bias or lack of female candidates at the pipeline level.  
- **Promotion Disparities:** Women at mid-management levels take longer to be promoted compared to their male counterparts.  
- **Turnover Trends:** Performance ratings of women who leave are comparable to or higher than those who stay, indicating potential systemic challenges.  

### Technologies & Tools Used
- **Power BI â€“** Data visualization and dashboard creation
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) â€“** Custom calculations for KPIs
- **Power Query â€“** Data transformation and cleansing
