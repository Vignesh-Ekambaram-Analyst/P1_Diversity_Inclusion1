# Diversity & Inclusion Dashboard Analysis

1. **Project Title**  
   Diversity & Inclusion Dashboard Analysis

2. **Objective or Problem Statement**  
   2.1.**Objective:**  
   To analyze and visualize key Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) metrics within an organization, providing actionable insights to improve gender balance, promote inclusivity, and inform strategic HR decisions.  
   
   2.2.**Problem Statement:**  
   How can we effectively measure and visualize D&I metrics to identify areas for improvement in hiring, promotions, turnover, and executive representation across different job levels and age groups?

3. **Data Source**  
   HR dataset containing employee information including gender, job level, performance ratings, promotion history, and age groups for fiscal years 2020 and 2021.

4. **Tools and Techniques**  
   - **Tools:** Power BI for dashboard creation and data visualization  
   - **Techniques:**  
     - DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for custom calculations  
     - Interactive slicers and filters for dynamic data exploration

5. **Approach**  
   - Data cleaning and preparation in Power Query  
   - Design of interactive dashboards with multiple KPIs  
   - Implementation of slicers for filtering by job level, department, and fiscal year  
   - Creation of custom measures for calculating percentages and averages

6. **Key Insights**  
   6.1 **Hiring Trends:**  
   - Overall hiring consists of 41% female and 59% male employees  
   - Lower female representation in senior roles (Executive: 13%, Director: 14%)  
   
   6.2 **Promotions:**  
   - Higher percentage of male promotions across job levels  
   - Women spend less time in grade before promotion compared to men  
   
   6.3 **Executive Gender Balance:**  
   - Slight increase in female executives from FY20 (12.5%) to FY21 (13.33%)  
   - Significant gender gap persists in executive roles  
   
   6.4 **Performance Ratings:**  
   - Minimal difference in average ratings between women (2.42) and men (2.41)  
   
   6.5 **Age Distribution:**  
   - Majority of employees in the 20-29 age group (223 employees)
