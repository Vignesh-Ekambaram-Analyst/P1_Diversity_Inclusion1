## Diversity & Inclusion Dashboard Analysis

### Project Objective
To analyze and visualize key Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) metrics within an organization, providing actionable insights to improve gender balance, promote inclusivity, and inform strategic HR decisions.

### Problem Statement
How can we effectively measure and visualize D&I metrics to identify areas for improvement in hiring, promotions, turnover, and executive representation across different job levels and age groups?

### Data Source
HR dataset containing employee information including gender, job level, performance ratings, promotion history, and age groups for fiscal years 2020 and 2021.

### Tools & Techniques
- Power BI for dashboard creation and data visualization
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for custom calculations
- Interactive slicers and filters for dynamic data exploration

### Approach
1. Data cleaning and preparation in Power Query
2. Design of interactive dashboards with multiple KPIs
3. Implementation of slicers for filtering by job level, department, and fiscal year
4. Creation of custom measures for calculating percentages and averages

### Key Insights
**1. Hiring Trends:**
   - Overall hiring consists of 41% female and 59% male employees
   - Lower female representation in senior roles (Executive: 13%, Director: 14%)

**2. Promotions:**
   - Higher percentage of male promotions across job levels
   - Women spend less time in grade before promotion compared to men

**3. Executive Gender Balance:**
   - Slight increase in female executives from FY20 (12.5%) to FY21 (13.33%)
   - Significant gender gap persists in executive roles

**4. Performance Ratings:**
   - Minimal difference in average ratings between women (2.42) and men (2.41)

**5. Age Distribution:**
   - Majority of employees in the 20-29 age group (223 employees)
   - Senior roles predominantly occupied by 40-49 age group

### Impact
- Provides a comprehensive view of D&I metrics for data-driven decision making
- Highlights areas requiring targeted interventions for improving gender balance
- Enables tracking of progress in D&I initiatives over time

### Challenges Faced
- Ensuring data accuracy and consistency across different metrics
- Designing an intuitive interface that presents complex data clearly
- Balancing the level of detail with overall dashboard performance

### Reflection
This project enhanced my skills in:
- Creating interactive and insightful Power BI dashboards
- Analyzing complex HR data to derive meaningful insights
- Presenting data in a way that tells a clear story about organizational diversity
